    <p>Layout Structure: The landing page follows a clean and simple layout structure with a header, product section, and footer. This structure ensures that users can easily navigate the website and find the information they need. Each section is clearly distinguished, creating a smooth flow from one part of the page to another.</p>
    <p>Responsive Design: The page is fully responsive, utilizing Bootstrap’s grid system and media queries to adjust the layout based on the user’s device. This makes the page look great on both mobile devices and desktops, ensuring a consistent user experience across different screen sizes.</p>
    <p>Color Scheme: A minimal color palette was chosen to maintain a professional and modern look. Shades of white, black, and gray were used for the background, text, and borders. Accent colors were applied to buttons and call-to-action elements to make them stand out.</p>
    <p>Typography: Clear and readable fonts were selected to enhance readability and make the text visually appealing. The font sizes for headings and body text were chosen to create a visual hierarchy, guiding the user’s attention from the main heading to secondary information.</p>
    <p>Navigation Bar: The navigation bar was designed to be simple and functional. It includes the online store’s name/logo on the left and navigation links on the right, making it easy for users to jump between sections. Bootstrap’s responsive navbar component was used to ensure the menu collapses into a hamburger icon on smaller screens.</p>
    <p>Product Section: The product section uses Bootstrap cards to showcase the products. Each card contains an image, product name, description, and a "Shop Now" button, providing essential information at a glance. The layout was designed to be visually appealing with even spacing, ensuring that each product stands out.</p>
    <p>Hover Effects: Subtle hover effects were added to buttons, particularly the "Shop Now" buttons, to enhance interactivity and user engagement. When hovered over, the buttons change color to draw attention and encourage users to click.</p>
    <p>Footer: The footer includes social media icons, links to other sections, and copyright information. The icons are styled using Font Awesome and are easily recognizable, encouraging users to engage with the store on social media platforms.

    </p>
    <p>Use of Bootstrap: Bootstrap’s components and grid system were used extensively to ensure rapid development and responsiveness. Predefined classes like btn, card, navbar, and container were customized to fit the overall theme of the online store.

    </p>
    <p>Visual Balance: Spacing and padding were carefully applied to create a visually balanced design, ensuring that no section feels overcrowded. This enhances the user experience by making the content more digestible and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
